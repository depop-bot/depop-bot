According to the [ThreadUp 2020 Report](https://www.thredup.com/resale/#resale-growth), the secondhand market is expected to grow to $64 Billion by 2024. This is due to a lot of factors which include but not limited to:

*   Growing support of consumers worldwide to the secondhand market
*   Increasing awareness of people to the impact of fast fashion to the environment
*   Breaking the stigma of wearing secondhand clothes
*   Increasing number of people discovering the profitability in selling secondhand clothes.

One of the leading websites in the US that caters to the secondhand market is Depop. And if you found this article on Google search, then chances are you are also thinking of joining this industry or perhaps, you are already selling on Depop and you’re thinking of how to further grow your business.

I’m an also an online seller and I’ve been selling secondhand fashion goods online for a few years now and I’m here to share with you some tips on how to grow your Depop shop using a [Depop Bot](https://bump.bot/).

Let’s start, shall we?

## Increase Your Depop Followers

Every Depop seller knows that having a large follower on Depop is crucial to the growth of your online selling business. And the easiest way to gain followers is to follow your fellow Depop users.

Manually following users takes some time and a Depop bot can help you automatically follow people. Depop bots can auto-follow:

*   A User’s Followers
*   Individual Users
*   Users Reviewers/Buyers
*   People Who Have Liked a Specific Product

And much more.

## Refresh Your Listings

Refreshing your listings on Depop means, editing and saving your listing to make it appear on top of the feeds of your followers. It sounds really simple if you’re just going to do it for 1, 2 or even 5 listings per day. But if you have hundreds or thousands of items posted on Depop then it can be a very grueling task.

Depop bots can do this for you automatically so you can focus on the other aspects of your business.

You can also schedule your refreshes and set the intervals depending on your liking. 

## Send Messages to Depop Users

Promoting your shop directly to Depop users is another time-consuming task. Luckily, Depop bots can automate this also for you.

You can easily send messages to individuals or group of people like your followers, buyers or even to people who liked a particular listing on Depop.

This is actually one of my favorite feature because this feature can be a great way to sell your items real fast.

## Increase Rate of Sales Conversion

Some Depop bots have a neat feature that will allow you to send automatic messages to people who will like your listings. What does it mean for you as a seller? This is a great way to seal the deal or to convert these likes into sales.

When a user ‘likes’ a listing, they are basically expressing your interest to your item and this is a great opportunity to pitch your offer and close the sale, automatically using a Depop bot!

## Final Thoughts

These are just some of the ways to grow your Depop shop with the help of a Depop bot. Although most Depop bots have similar features, some may have additional features that you might also find useful.

I highly suggest that before you pay for any Depop bot service, to give it a try first to see which one will suit you best.

Almost all Depop bots offer free trials in varying timelines. Some offer free trials for just a few days, but most offer at least a week of free trials. 

If you don’t have much inventory yet and if you don’t require more than 50 refreshes a day, I also suggest that you check out [Bump.bot](https://bump.bot/). 

Bump.bot is a Chrome-extension Depop bot that offers free use forever if you will only do around 50 refreshes a day. Once your inventory grows, you may opt to move to its paid option which only costs $9.99 per month for unlimited refreshes.
